# AirBnB Clone - The Console

  
## Getting Started

**This console is a command line interpreter for the AirBnB clone**

> we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:


- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)

- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…

- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)

- Update attributes of an object

- Destroy an object

## Execution

  
This shell works like this in interactive mode:

  
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF help quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py

(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================

EOF help quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

  
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF help quit
(hbnb)
$

```
